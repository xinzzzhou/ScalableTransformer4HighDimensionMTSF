## Datasets
Please access the well-pre-processed Crime-Chicago and Wiki-People datasets from [[Google Drive]](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1O-LcxA3TGTFMpCAybA6OmRXEfjdA8q8W?usp=drive_link), then place the downloaded contents under the corresponding folders of `/dataset`

## Quick Demo
1. Clone this repository
```
git clone git@github.com:xinzzzhou/ScalableTransformer4HighDimensionMTSF.git
cd ScalableTransformer4HighDimensionMTSF
```
2. Config environment
```
conda create --name sthd python=3.9
conda activate sthd
pip install -r requirement.txt
```
3. Download datasets and place them under the corresponding folders of `/dataset`
4. Train and test the model. We provide two main.py files for demonstration purpose under the root folder. For example, you can train and test Crime-Chicago dataset by:
   
***Relation sparsity.***
Run datasets/top-k-train corr-compute.py to get the correlation, modeling with the accelerated computation - DeepGraph. 
```
python datasets/top-k-train/corr-compute.py
```

***Run the main file.***
Config the parameters and run run.py to train and evaluate the model. 
```
python run_crime.py
```
